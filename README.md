Benchmark for the sampling procedure used in the Mass Spec paper.

The method employs a custom [MS connectivity restraint](http://integrativemodeling.org/2.5.0/doc/ref/classIMP_1_1core_1_1MSConnectivityRestraint.html) implemented in C++ within the open source [IMP](http://integrativemodeling.org/) program. It is capable of sampling and evaluating candidate structures from information derived from connectivity information (e.g. native MS, cross-linking MS). The method exploits a Monte Carlo search followed by a conjugate gradients (CG) optimization step. From a large number of candidate model structures generated by sampling the conformational spaces of input structures (at the moment two input coordinate files are allowed), the algorithm gives a score (MS connectivity score) based on a Minimal Spanning Tree approach.

## Steps

Each case in the benchmark is placed in its own directory (e.g. `tAABC`). The procedure is the same for each benchmark case; a number of Python scripts should be run in that directory. The assumption is made that IMP is already installed and is available in the Python path.

### 1. Generation and optimization of structural models

Models can be generated by running `ms_cg.py`.

This script first sets up the proteins in the system by calling `create_protein`. This takes two arguments, the name of the protein and the number of residues. For example, `create_protein("ProteinA", 100)` creates a protein called `ProteinA` containing 100 residues.

The connectivity restraint (`IMP.core.MSConnectivityRestraint`) is then set up. It is told how many copies of each protein are present by calling `add_type`. For example:

        iA = r.add_type([rps[0], rps[1], rps[2]]) # three copies of protein A
        iB = r.add_type([rps[3]]) # one copy of protein B
        iC = r.add_type([rps[4]]) # one copy of protein C

Next it is told the disassembly pathway of protein complexes by calling `add_composite`, for example:

        n1 = r.add_composite([iA, iB, iC, iD])
        n2 = r.add_composite([iA, iB, iC], n1)
        n3 = r.add_composite([iA, iB], n2)
        n4 = r.add_composite([iA, iC], n2)
        n5 = r.add_composite([iA, iB, iD], n1)
        n6 = r.add_composite([iB, iD], n5)

The above commands correspond to the disassembly pathway below:
(todo)

The optimization can be tuned by editing the Python script. Common optimization parameters include the number of Monte Carlo steps, the number of conjugate gradient steps, and the number of models to generate. Generally speaking, more models should be generated for more topologically complex systems, or those containing many subunits.

### 2. Output and visualization

The `ms_cg.py` script generates a number of structural models created by putting together the input proteins and their number of copies. Each model is named `output/model/configuration.<number>.pym`, and can be visualized in the PyMol program. The scores for each structure calculated using the MS connectivity restraint are output as `output/scores.txt`.

The script also generates clusters as `output/model/cluster.<number>.pym`, employing a k-means clustering approach. The number of clusters and the number of iterations used to generate them can be changed by editing the `ms_cg.py` script.

### 3. Comparing the generated models with the known topologies

The algorithm can be benchmarked by measuring the closeness-of-fit between the structural models and known topologies. The first step is to convert the `*.pym` files into `*.mfj`. This can be done by first running the `pym2tcl.py` script and then the `tcl2mfj.py` script. These generate `*.mfj` files in the `output/mfj` directory.

Next, run the `score_connect.py` script which compares the topologies of structural models generated with the native-like topology usually obtained from the reference structure by scoring a) the interactions and b) the non-interactions. This means that if any interaction that exists in the reference structure is not found in the model, a penalty of 2.0 is added to this model. If, on the other hand, a non-existing interaction in the reference structure is found in the model, then the model receives a penalty of 1.0. The scores are summarized in the output file `output/score-connect.txt`.
